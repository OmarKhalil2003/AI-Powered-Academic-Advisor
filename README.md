# AI Curriculum Planner â€“ Adaptive Academic Advising Using Reinforcement Learning

This project simulates a university academic advising system using reinforcement learning (RL) and curriculum graph modeling. It generates personalized course recommendations for 100 students based on interests, GPA, and prerequisite constraints.

---

##  Features

- Curriculum modeled as a directed graph (courses & prerequisites)
- 100 simulated students with:
  - GPA, completed courses, and academic interests
- Course recommendation logic using a custom RL environment
- Term-wise simulation (max 6 terms)
- Retake policy for failed courses
- Graduation tracking
- Visual comparison between AI, Data Science, and Security students
- Full result logging + CSV/JSON outputs
